# Face Detection App

## Description
The Face Detection App is a Python application that leverages the OpenCV (cv2) library to detect human faces in images and live video streams. This project provides a user-friendly interface to upload images or enable your webcam for real-time face detection. It is an excellent tool for various applications, including security, image processing, and computer vision.
